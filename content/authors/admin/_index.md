**Dr. Bradley E. White** is a postdoctoral Neuroimaging Scientist in the <a href="https://www.petitto.net" target="_blank">Petitto Brain and Language Laboratory for Neuroimaging</a> at Gallaudet University. His research program explores the impacts of hearing devices across the lifespan.

"Huh?" "What?" You may find yourself asking these questions more often when talking on the phone or with someone who has an accent. In fact, everyday listening frequently occurs under a wide range of inescapable suboptimal and adverse conditions. These challenges are exacerbated by reduced hearing acuity and the use of imperfect hearing amplification and prosthetic devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants. Dr. White investigates how such hearing devices impact the human brain and behavior throughout life, from early development to ageing.
